# Introduction

Welcome! 

This book explains how to build a website using _Vue.js_, a progressive Javascript framework for building user interfaces. Vue is lightweight enough to be used in an existing website to introduce some extra functionality, or as the main front end framework for a professional grade, large scale SPA \(single page application\).

This books assumes basic knowledge of HTML, CSS and Javascript, but starts from scratch, so anyone with a programming background should be able to pick it up fairly easily. Unlike some others books, I want to also introduce and explain how the tooling works, which is relevant to developing any modern website, not just ones using Vue. 

One of the great things about Vue is its simplicity. To get started, all you need to do is include it in a `<script>` tag at the top the main `index.html` file. However, when building large, complex apps, tools such as _yarn_ and _npm_ \(package managers\), _webpack_ \(a bundler\), and others. If you are not familiar with these, don't worry! I will introduce them incrementally and explain how and why they are used.
