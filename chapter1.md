# Chapter 1: First look at Vue

What is Vue.js?

Vue.js \(from here on, Vue\) is a JavaScript framework created by and mantained by Evan You in 2015. It is coined a 'progressive' framework - one that provides a small, yet solid core API, and can be expanded with modules as needed.

This book assumes basic knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. If you have some background in programming, it should be easy enough, even without much working knowledge in JavaScript.

Let's get write into it. Each chapter will start by building a small applciation to demonstrate different features, and later build a clone of the popular programming news board, hacker news, complete with test driven development, and an NPM powered workflow.

To get started, include Vue from a CDN, and create a simple HTML template to host the Vue app.
